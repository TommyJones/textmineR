Functions for Text Mining and Topic Modeling 

Copyright 2021 by Thomas W. Jones

An aid for text mining in R, with a syntax that
    is more familiar to experienced R users. Also, implements various functions
    related to topic modeling, making it a good topic modeling work bench.
    

textmineR was created with three principles in mind:

1. Maximize interoperability within R's ecosystem 
2. Scaleable in terms of object storeage and computation time
3. Syntax that is idiomatic to R

Please see the vignettes for more information on how to get started.

Note: there's a lot going on with textmineR at the moment, including adding 
functionality based on original research.
